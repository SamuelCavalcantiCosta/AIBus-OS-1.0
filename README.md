## 🚌 Vision

AIBus-OS is an open-source initiative to democratize autonomous public transportation technology. We believe autonomous buses can revolutionize urban mobility by:

- Making public transport **accessible to all** through reduced operational costs
- Enabling **free or low-cost transit** when implemented by municipalities 
- Creating a **24/7 available** transportation network
- Reducing **carbon emissions** through optimized routing and electric powertrains

## 🔍 Project Overview

AIBus-OS provides a modular framework for developing and implementing autonomous bus systems with a focus on safety, accessibility, and sustainability. This project is designed to be adaptable for various environments, from dedicated lanes to mixed traffic scenarios.
